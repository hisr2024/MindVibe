    testimonial:
      'I carried a conversation with my mother for almost two years. Not the whole conversation, just one sentence she said, playing on repeat every time I tried to sleep. Karma Reset didn\'t make that sentence disappear. But somewhere during the breathing part, I realized I had been holding my jaw so tight that my teeth ached. I let it go. Not the memory, just the grip. That was enough. I sleep a little easier now, and I\'ve stopped rehearsing my response to something that already happened.',

    testimonial:
      'After my divorce, I kept a mental list of everything I did wrong. I would add to it at random moments, in the shower, while cooking, while driving. Karma Reset asked me to name what I was holding, and when I wrote it down, I saw how small and specific each thing actually was. They weren\'t the massive failures I had inflated them into. The process helped me see that guilt had become a habit, not a truth. I still think about what happened, but the weight of it sits differently now.',

    initial: 'A',
    testimonial:
      'I used to avoid looking at old photos because every happy moment reminded me of the version of myself I thought I had ruined. The reset process was quiet and unhurried, which surprised me. I expected something dramatic. Instead, it felt like sitting with a patient friend who wasn\'t trying to fix anything. I cried during the breathing exercise, not from sadness, but from relief. I look at those photos now and feel tenderness instead of shame.',

    testimonial:
      'I have been sober for three years, but the guilt from what I put my family through never really left. It lived in the pause before I answered the phone when my sister called. Karma Reset didn\'t erase that pause, but it gave me a way to sit with it without spiraling. The ripple exercise helped me understand that acknowledging harm doesn\'t mean I have to keep punishing myself for it. I called my sister that evening. We talked about nothing important, and it was the best conversation we\'ve had in years.',

    name: 'Priya M.',
    initial: 'P',
    testimonial:
      'I left a friendship badly. No fight, no closure, just silence that stretched into months and then years. I would see her name on social media and feel this hollow ache, not quite sadness, more like something unfinished. Going through the reset, I realized I wasn\'t just grieving the friendship. I was grieving the version of myself who would have handled it better. The forward intention step helped me accept that some things end without resolution, and that doesn\'t make me a bad person.',

    name: 'Marcus W.',
    initial: 'M',
    testimonial:
      'I spent years replaying a mistake I made at work that cost someone their project. Every professional success after that felt undeserved, like I was borrowing time before people found out who I really was. The reset didn\'t tell me I was wrong to feel that way. It helped me separate the action from the identity. I did something careless. That is different from being a careless person. It sounds simple when I write it, but feeling the difference in my body during the breathing exercise was something I hadn\'t expected.',

    testimonial:
      'My therapist once told me I intellectualize my feelings, and she was right. I could explain exactly why I felt guilty about how I treated my ex, but understanding it didn\'t make it lighter. What surprised me about Karma Reset was how physical it felt. The breathing slowed something down in my chest that I didn\'t know was racing. I wouldn\'t say I\'m healed. But I would say I stopped running from the feeling, and that has made the days gentler.',

    initial: 'A',
    testimonial:
      'I grew up being told that asking for forgiveness is weakness. So I never did, not out loud, not even to myself. The guilt from that just calcified over the years until I couldn\'t tell the difference between guilt and personality. Karma Reset gave me a private space to say the things I couldn\'t say to anyone. Naming the ripple was the hardest part. But once I did, I felt something shift, not a breakthrough, just a small crack where some light got through.',

    initial: 'E',
    testimonial:
      'After my miscarriage, I blamed myself in ways I couldn\'t explain to anyone. I would lie awake cataloging every cup of coffee, every stressful day, every moment I didn\'t rest enough. Logic told me it wasn\'t my fault, but grief doesn\'t listen to logic. The reset process met me where I was without trying to rationalize the pain away. The repair step helped me write something kind to myself, which felt foreign and necessary at the same time. I read it again sometimes when the old thoughts return.',

    testimonial:
      'I said something cruel to my son during an argument last year. He has forgiven me. My wife has moved on. But I kept replaying the look on his face, that single second of hurt before he turned away. Karma Reset didn\'t minimize what I did. It helped me see that holding onto that image wasn\'t protecting him, it was just keeping me stuck. The intention step helped me focus on what I could do next instead of what I had already done. I am learning to be gentler, starting with myself.',

    testimonial:
      'For months, I avoided mirrors. Not because of how I looked, but because eye contact with myself brought up everything I was running from. A failed business. Borrowed money I couldn\'t return. Friends I had disappointed. Karma Reset asked me to name just one thing, not the whole list. That felt manageable. I named the borrowed money. Breathing through it, I felt the shame loosen just slightly, like unclenching a fist I forgot I was making. I still owe the money. But I no longer owe myself punishment for it.',

    testimonial:
      'I was the one who didn\'t show up when my best friend needed me most. He was going through something dark, and I told myself I\'d call tomorrow. Tomorrow became a week, then a month. He\'s okay now, but I carry the silence like a stone in my pocket. The reset didn\'t remove the stone. It helped me hold it differently, with open hands instead of a clenched fist. The forward intention I wrote was simple: show up, even when it\'s uncomfortable. I\'ve been practicing that, imperfectly, and it\'s enough.',
