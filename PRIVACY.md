## Data Security

We take data security seriously and implement industry-standard measures:

### Encryption

- **TLS/SSL** for all data transmission
- **Encrypted storage** for sensitive data at rest
- **EdDSA cryptographic signatures** for enhanced security

#### Encryption Practices Verification
- TLS 1.2+ enforced for all HTTPS traffic; HSTS is enabled in the frontend to prevent downgrade attacks
- AES-256 encryption is applied to database volumes and backups where supported by the hosting provider
- Secrets (API keys, database credentials, signing keys) are stored only in environment variables or managed secret stores—not in source control
- Passwords are hashed using strong, salted algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) before storage
- Backup exports are encrypted prior to transfer and retained only for the minimum retention period

### Access Controls
- Strong password requirements
- JWT-based authentication
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Regular security audits

We collect only the data necessary to provide our services and delete data when no longer needed.
