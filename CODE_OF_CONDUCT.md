## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns, please report it by contacting the project maintainers at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. Reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality to the extent possible.

When reporting an incident, please include:

- Your name and contact information (unless you wish to remain anonymous)
- The time, date, and location of the incident
- The names of any people involved and any witnesses
- A description of what happened
- Any supporting evidence (for example screenshots)

## Enforcement Process

Reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team will determine whether disruptive or inappropriate behavior has occurred and may choose to take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from asking a participant to stop certain behaviors to temporary or permanent bans from the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public or private online spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples include project-related communication channels, issue trackers, mailing lists, and social media accounts used to discuss the project.

## Scope (continued)

This Code of Conduct applies both online and in-person at project-sponsored events.
