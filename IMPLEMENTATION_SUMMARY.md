# Universal Wisdom Chatbot - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a universal wisdom chatbot for MindVibe that presents Bhagavad Gita teachings in a completely secular, universally applicable way without any religious references.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Structure
- **Location**: `data/wisdom/verses.json`
- **Content**: 10 carefully selected wisdom verses covering key mental health themes
- **Languages**: English, Hindi, and Sanskrit translations
- **Features**: 
  - Each verse tagged with mental health applications
  - Context explaining the practical application
  - Already sanitized English translations

### 2. Database Model
- **File**: `models.py`
- **Added**: `WisdomVerse` model with fields:
  - verse_id, chapter, verse_number
  - theme (e.g., "action_without_attachment")
  - english, hindi, sanskrit translations
  - context and mental_health_applications
  - Optional embedding field for future semantic search

### 3. Knowledge Base Service
- **File**: `services/wisdom_kb.py`
- **Class**: `WisdomKnowledgeBase`
- **Key Features**:
  - **Text sanitization**: Automatically removes/replaces religious terminology
    - "Krishna" → "the teacher"
    - "Arjuna" → "the student"
    - "Lord" → "the wise one"
    - "God" → "inner wisdom"
    - "Divine" → "universal"
  - **Semantic search**: Finds relevant verses based on query similarity
  - **Theme-based search**: Filter verses by theme
  - **Application-based search**: Find verses by mental health application
  - **Multi-language formatting**: Returns verses in requested language

### 4. API Endpoints
- **File**: `routes/wisdom_guide.py`
- **Base Path**: `/api/wisdom`
- **Endpoints**:

  1. **POST `/api/wisdom/query`**
     - Query the wisdom guide with a mental health concern
     - Returns AI-generated guidance + relevant verses
     - Supports language preference (english/hindi/sanskrit)
     - Optional Sanskrit inclusion

  2. **GET `/api/wisdom/themes`**
     - List all available wisdom themes
     - Formatted for easy UI display

  3. **GET `/api/wisdom/verses/{verse_id}`**
     - Retrieve a specific verse
     - Language selection support

### 5. AI Integration
- **OpenAI GPT-4 Integration**:
  - Generates personalized responses based on user queries
  - System prompt ensures NO religious terminology is used
  - Falls back to template responses if API key not configured
  - Context-aware based on relevant verses

### 6. Configuration
- **Settings**: Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `core/settings.py`
- **Environment**: Updated `.env.example` with new configuration
- **Dependencies**: Added to `requirements.txt`:
  - openai>=0.27.0,<2.0.0
  - numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0
  - asyncpg>=0.27.0,<0.28.0

### 7. Seeding Script
- **File**: `seed_wisdom.py`
- **Purpose**: Populate database with wisdom verses from JSON
- **Usage**: `python seed_wisdom.py`
- **Features**: 
  - Checks for existing verses to avoid duplicates
  - Loads from `data/wisdom/verses.json`
  - Properly formats mental_health_applications field

### 8. Documentation
- **File**: `docs/wisdom_guide.md`
- **Contents**:
  - API endpoint documentation with examples
  - Configuration guide
  - Mental health applications list
  - Usage examples
  - Future enhancement ideas

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Universal Presentation
All wisdom is presented without any religious context:
- No mention of Krishna, Arjuna, or Hindu deities
- No religious terminology in responses
- Focus on practical mental health applications
- Timeless principles applicable to anyone

### 2. Multi-Language Support
- English: Primary language, pre-sanitized
- Hindi: Original Hindi translation (Devanagari script)
- Sanskrit: Original Sanskrit verses
- Users can choose their preferred language

### 3. Mental Health Focus
Each verse is tagged with specific applications:
- anxiety_management
- stress_reduction
- emotional_regulation
- self_empowerment
- mindfulness
- And 35+ more categories

### 4. AI-Powered Responses
- Uses GPT-4 when available
- Strict system prompts prevent religious language
- Fallback to template responses ensures functionality without API key
- Context-aware based on relevant verses

### 5. Semantic Search
- Simple text similarity algorithm (word overlap)
- Ready for upgrade to sentence-transformers embeddings
- Multi-factor scoring (theme, content, context)

## Testing & Verification

Created `verify_wisdom.py` script that tests:
- Model imports
- Service functionality
- Text sanitization
- Data validation
- Route imports

All syntax checks passed ✓
