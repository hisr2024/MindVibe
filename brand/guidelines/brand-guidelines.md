# MindVibe & KIAAN — Brand Guidelines

## Brand Overview
**MindVibe** is a premium, calming spiritual wellness ecosystem designed to feel universal, inclusive, and emotionally intelligent—on par with Calm, Headspace, and Insight Timer. The experience is modern, warm, and glow-kissed.

**KIAAN — MindVibe Companion** is the wise, gentle guide inside MindVibe. It delivers *crisp, calm guidance* with an elegant flute + peacock feather identity that is symbolic but not religious.

---

## Identity Pillars
- **Modern & Timeless**: rounded geometry, balanced spacing, premium gradients.
- **Emotionally Intelligent**: warm tonalities, soft glows, zero visual noise.
- **Universal & Inclusive**: culture-agnostic symbolism, clear accessibility defaults.
- **Companionable**: everything should feel like a gentle presence rather than a tool.

## Gradient Palette Themes
Each theme uses soft falloffs and gentle glow; prefer radial overlays at 20–30% opacity for warmth.

1. **Orange–Gold (Warmth & Optimism)**  
   `#FF6B35 → #F7931E → #FFD700` (HSL 18°, 100%, 60% → 32°, 93%, 55% → 51°, 100%, 50%)  
   Use for core CTAs, celebratory states, and the MindVibe badge halo.

2. **Teal–Sky (Inner Peace)**  
   `#0FB5C9 → #43D3E8 → #A8E8FF` (HSL 186°, 88%, 44% → 189°, 77%, 59% → 200°, 100%, 83%)  
   Use for Inner Peace flows, breathing guides, and ambient overlays.

3. **Rose–Lilac (Self Kindness)**  
   `#FF6B9D → #C77DFF → #E6C9FF` (HSL 342°, 100%, 72% → 276°, 100%, 74% → 274°, 100%, 91%)  
   Use for supportive nudges, journaling, and compassionate states.

**Focus Blue Accent (Mind Control)**: `#1E40AF → #3B82F6 → #80B3F6` for precision and cognitive clarity.

## Typography & Voice
- **Primary**: Inter (body, UI, captions) — clean, approachable, highly legible.
- **Secondary**: Manrope (display, hero, emphasis) — rounded geometry for softness.
- **Wordmarks**: Custom letterspacing; MindVibe +0.02em, KIAAN +0.12–0.15em uppercase.
- **Micro-tagline**: “Your Guide to Inner Peace” sits beneath the lockup at 12–14px, 0.06–0.08em tracking.
- Tone: sincere, reassuring, concise. Avoid jargon or clinical language.

---

## Iconography & Interaction Language
- **Grid**: 24×24px base with 2px rounded strokes; filled variants for active states only.
- **Shapes**: Soft chamfers, pill buttons, 12–16px corner radii on cards.
- **Glows**: Use themed glows (`20–35px blur`, `0.2–0.4 opacity`) matching palette; never hard shadows.
- **Interactions**: Hover = 105% scale + 30% glow; Tap = 110% scale + 50% glow + 30ms delay to settle.

---

## KIAAN Symbolism (Modern, Non-religious)
- **Flute**: Forms the K stem or an underline; metallic shimmer passes once every 8s or on hover.
- **Peacock Feather**: Minimal, elongated curve with gold eye; slow sway loop and sparkled aura.
- **Energy Ripple**: Concentric ripple behind the wordmark; represents resonance and clarity.
- **Lockup**: “KIAAN” embossed gradient, subtitle **MindVibe Companion**, micro-tagline below when space allows.

---

## Application Guidance
- Pair **MindVibe** orange–gold with **KIAAN** teal/blue for elegant contrast; avoid using both primaries at 100% in the same element—alternate primaries with neutral surfaces (`#0B0B0F` dark, `#F8FAFC` light).
- Loading, onboarding, and guidance states should use KIAAN animation; primary navigation and dashboards prioritize MindVibe badge + wordmark.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; provide static lockups and toned-down glows for accessibility.

---

## File & Delivery Formats
- **Vector**: SVG for static icons/wordmarks; maintain gradients as CSS variables.
- **Animation**: Lottie JSON for app; WebM (alpha) for marketing; SVG/CSS for micro-interactions.
- **Exports**: 1×/2×/3× PNGs for social and store assets; PDF for print-safe lockups.
